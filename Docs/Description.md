As instructed by our dear teachers ([see here for full description] (https://github.com/itskennedy/project-work-y1-2015)), we are going to collect datas from the twitter API using Python, store them in MongoDB, clean them up with some awesome Java code and finally show them on an ASP.NET MVC website (using Google Charts for some eye candy and easyness!).


All the work will be divided in 4 [Milestones] (..blob/master/Docs/Milestones.md) and we will try using a "SCRUM"-like attitude, if possible.
