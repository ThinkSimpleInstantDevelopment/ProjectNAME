As instructed by our dear teachers ([see here for full description] (https://github.com/itskennedy/project-work-y1-2015)), we are going to collect datas from the twitter API using Python, store them in MongoDB, clean them up with some awesome Java code and finally show them on an ASP.NET MVC website (using Google Charts for some eye candy and easyness!).


All the work will be divided in 4 [Milestones] (./Milestones.md) and we will try using a "SCRUM"-like attitude, if possible.

Unfortunately, twitter API provide no more than 6-9 days of datas, so we will not be able to provide the full two year time period originally intended (we will instead start collecting data from now on).

To be prepared for the optional deployment on a cloud service, we are going to use a virtual machine as test for all the phases of the project; that way we will be ready anytime to fully deploy everything on any platform.
